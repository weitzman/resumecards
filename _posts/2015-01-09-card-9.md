Many have asked how I made this resume:

- Lives in [a repo on Github](https://github.com/weitzman/weitzman.github.io). You can submit a PR.
- Is a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/), served by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- I edit via the web and the resume is instantly re-published.
- [The content are Markdown files](https://github.com/weitzman/weitzman.github.io/tree/master/_posts).
- Styles are [authored in SASS](https://github.com/weitzman/weitzman.github.io/blob/master/stylesheets/resumecards.scss).
- Based on [ResumeCards ](http://github.com/ellekasai/resumecards).
