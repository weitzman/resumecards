Many have asked how I made this resume.

- My resume lives in [a repo on Github](https://github.com/weitzman/weitzman.github.io). You can submit a PR!
- Is a [Jekyll site], served by [Github pages].
- I can edit via the web and the resume gets instantly re-published.
- [The content are Markdown files]()
- Styles are writing in SASS and compiled to CSS
- Is based on the [open source ResumeCards project](http://github.com/ellekasai/resumecards)
